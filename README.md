# mvc
# model view controller
# controllers handles the data from the models and updates the view
# public will be the root directory where the index.php is based
# home/index view So home is the controller and index is the method within that controller
# after public/ you can access controllers and methods within that controllers
# home/index So here I want to access the index method in the home controller
# but since index and home is the default controller you will access the same view from just writing public/
